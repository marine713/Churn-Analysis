# Dynamic Routing
Dynamic routing is an order fulfilment strategy where orders are dynamically grouped to create an optimum delivery route. An optimum delivery route is one that will cost the least and ensures that the vehicle is optimally utilized. In this case I was required to address one element of dynamic routing which is clustering shops (`customer_id`) around fullfilment centres creating optimum routes.

# Churn Analysis
This repo also contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn, leveraging data science techniques to identify key factors driving customer attrition. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
